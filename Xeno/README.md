#Xeno


Description goes here....


###*What it is:*
This program is designed to teach students how to use basic JavaScript functions, while still being a complex program itself.

###*How it works:*
Their will be an interface with a GUI, which will allow students to select a topic they wish to see how it works, and be presented the code to do so.


###*How to use it:*
Feel free to explore the program, and learn on your own. It's pretty straight forward, however it is still recomended to read the Info Page, which can be found on the home screen in the program.

###*Contact the creators:*

Daneel Rakow - rsmtirish@gmail.com

Tyler Young - viterousgray@gmail.com

###*How to contribute:*

Feel free to send an email to viterousgray@gmail.com, to be informed and possibly added as a contributor.
Note: You will need some form of a portfolio so we can see what it is you do, and where you might fit in on the Xeno Project.

*In Progress:* Their will be a comments section in the program, which will read daily.

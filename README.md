# Portfolio
This is a portfolio project for Advanced Computer Science
It constists of three projects, Xeno, DesignTM, and PolarEquations. 
Xeno will be done in JavaScript, DesignTM will be done in Java, and PolarEquations will be done in Java and JavaScript.
# Xeno 
Xeno will be a program that uses javascript functions to produce sound waves, (to be able to visualize the frequency of each song), and be able to print the lyrics from the song on screen (sound recognition). 
# DesignTM
DesignTM is a project that has it's own recursion function to create a treemap. It organizes randomly given data from greatest to least, right to left, and top to bottom. 
# PolarEquations
PolarEquations is a program that converts cartesian to polar, and is able to graph polar equations.
